Greenfoot game
## Assignment:

AP Computer Science Project I
(Modified from Mr. Lew’s Fall Project)
This project will require you to design and implement a Java-based game or simulation. It will be completed in 4 phases. Each phase is described below:

Phase I - Proposal

Title of your project goes here (e.g. “Othello”)

Project Summary – 
Archer
The game is based on the popular game genre known as a platformer. Games that fall under the platform genre consists of the player going through obstacles such as block and enemies in order to reach a certain destination in the game. The point of the game is that the user takes control of the archer, the person in the middle with a bow and arrows. With the archer, the user must be able to reach the Golden Arrow which is located at the top of the map in order to complete the game and achieve victory. However the user must make it through obstacles such as the soldiers placed throughout the map. The user can either shoot arrows by pressing space, but it is good to note that there are only a limited amount of arrows that the user can have the archer shoot(30), or the user can decide to ignore them and not make contact with them and jump on the blocks to make their way to the Golden Arrow. The soldiers are placed throughout the map to make it more difficult the player to get the arrow and require to be careful with their actions. In order to help the user keep track of the amount of arrows left, there is a display on the screen which keeps track of how many more arrows they can shoot. The user is given the ability to make the archer jump,move to the left or right, and shoot arrows, in order to achieve the goal of the game.

Phase II – Java Program
The program must include the following items.
	1.	At least two relational (==, !=, >, >=, <, <=) and two logical operators ( &&, ||, !)
	2.	At least two “if-then-else” statements.
	3.	At least two of the following: for loop, for-each loop, and while loop.
	4.	At least ONE student-designed interface and THREE student-designed classes (one of which MUST be abstract), not including your driver class (e.g. “OthelloDriver.java”) – which brings the total to FIVE.
	5.	At least one instance of Class Composition (“has-a” relationship) must be used in your project. Recall that “Class Composition” is using another class as an “instance variable” for your class. 
	6.	Interaction between all your student-designed classes/interfaces in your project must be implemented. Specifically, each class must call method(s) from another class in your project.
	7.	An Inheritance hierarchy (“is-a” relationship) must be implemented with the student-designed 
	8.	At least one student-designed interface must be implemented in the project.
	9.	Polymorphism must be implemented with the student-designed classes.
	10.	Class ArrayList or a 2D Array must be used in at least ONE student-designed class and it MUST be traversed through AND accessed via a for loop OR a for-each loop.
	11.	Your project must demonstrate a high level of “algorithmic complexity.” That is, your “brain” or “processing” methods should show a high degree of problem solving ability.
	12.	Comments explaining logic and operation of program at “key points” (e.g. special algorithm to determine possible next moves in Chess, to check winners in Connect Four, to follow Pac-Man around the screen, etc.)
	13.	Meaningful and variable/class names throughout (class, methods, variable name, instance variables, etc.)
	14.	Including comments for each of your methods in at least student-designed class. 
     15.	Use of JOptionPane for user input.

See the website for ideas on projects. Projects whose code has been released are not eligible project ideas unless SIGNIFICANT changes are proposed that will make it UNIQUE from the original.

The Final Project is due on your assigned lottery date. THERE WILL BE A 15% deduction of points for each day that the project is late. There will be a 5 point deduction for each typographical or grammatical error.




 
Phase III – Project Submission Guidelines
Description:
The game is a basic platform game just like that of Super Mario. However some key differences is that you can shoot at the enemies to eliminate them and you take the form of an archer. To reach the end of the game, the archer must grab the Golden Arrow by going up to it and touch. Once the player has reached the arrow then the game is finished and prompts the player with a “You Win” screen, indicating that the player has beaten the game. The player can utilize their arrows but must use them as purposefully as possible to ensure victory.

How To Play:
Click “Left” to move left and “Right” to move right. Press the “Up” key to jump. Press down the “Space” key to shoot an arrow.

Interesting Features:
The player can do somewhat of a double jump when the archer jumps on a block

The player only has a limited amount of arrow(30) that they can use before they run out



 
Phase IV – Presentation (This is tentative as of 5/16/18)
A Powerpoint/Keynote presentation should be given on your lottery date. The presentation shall have, at minimum, the following slides:
a.	Title
b.	Description of program operation (or how game is played)
c.	Demonstration of Program (Task switch from your slide show presentation to your program using Alt-Tab or Cmd-Tab)
d.	UML Diagrams for each class
e.	Use of classes/objects in project - elaborate on how classes represent physical objects in your program (be prepared to justify class names, class data member names, class method names…)
f.	Description of class interaction (be prepared to discuss how each class interacts with the other classes)
g.	Description of use of an inheritance hierarchy (be prepared to justify structure)
h.	Description of use of an interface (be prepared to justify its use with other classes)
i.	Description of use of polymorphism (include a code snippet that demonstrates polymorphism)
j.	Special features implemented in program - elaborate on tricks/special things you did
k.	Known bugs in program
l.	Citation of “second-party” code used in program (be able to explain code; not including GridWorld GUI)
m.	Conclusion - Summary of what you thought of writing the program 
	i.	Difficulty level, 
	ii. 	"Fun" level, 
	iii. 	Your evaluation of the final product, 
iv.	What you learned (be specific)
n.	Questions? (this is simply a slide that says “Questions?” that keys the audience for any questions they might have)


Pointers for your final project:
1.	START EARLY!! Don’t wait until after Christmas to begin your project!! 
2.	Test your program on the presentation computer before the presentation date.
3.	Using System.out.println() statements to display values during the debugging process.
4.	MAKE BACKUPS OF YOUR WORK!!
5.	And, of course,…HAVE FUN :-) !!
